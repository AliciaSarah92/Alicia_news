Hi, welcome to my repo. If you want to clone this repo, you will not have access to the environment variables. 

You will need to create two .env files: .env.test and .env.development. 

Into each of the files, please add PGDATABASE=, with the correct database name for that environment (see /db/setup.sql for the database names). 

Double check that these .env files are .gitignored.
